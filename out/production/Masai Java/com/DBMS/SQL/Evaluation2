Question1
Person Table
create table person
(personId int primary key, lastName varchar(20), firstName varchar(20) );
Insert into person values(1,’shah’,’Amit’);
Insert into person values(2,’dhoni’,’Mahendra’);
Address Table
create table address
(addressId int primary key, personId int, city varchar(20),state varchar(20) );
Insert into Address values (1,1,’gandhinagar’,’Jammu’);
Insert into Address values (2,3,’ranchi’,’Jharkhand’);
Insert into Address values (3,4,’Mumbai’,’Maharashtra’);
Ans Query--
 select firstName,lastName,city,state from person left join address on person.personId=address.personId;

Question2
A transaction is a sequence of operations performed (using one or more SQL statements) on a database as a single logical unit of work.
ex:
•	withdrawing money from the ATM
•	transfering amount from one account to another.
In order to maintain consistancy in DB , before and after the transaction certain properties should be followd
these are called ACID properties.
A: Atomicity : (All or noting rule) the entire transaction takes place at once or does not happens at all.
C: Consistent: the database must be Consistent before and after transaction
I: Isoloated: multiple transaction should occurs independently at a time without any interference.
D: Durability: The changes of a sucessfull transaction should be permanent even if system failure occurs.

Question 3
Ans Query : - select c.email, count(c.email) from customers c inner join orders o on c.customer_id = o.customer_id and  year(order_placed_date)= 2016 group by c.email order by  count(c.email) desc ;

Question4
Normalization:-
Normalization is a process of organizing the data in database to avoid the redundancy (duplication). because of data redundancy there are several problems in the databases.
Uses=>
•	It is use to remove anamolies from the database.
•	It is used to divide large table into small table.

2NF => 2NF applies in a table which is having a composite key, i.e a table with a primary key compound with two or more attribute.
- a table with a single column primary key is automatically in 2NF.
-to be in 2nF, a table must be in 1stNF  and the table must not contains any partial dependency.
Ex-  suppose a table  name as Student and we store rollNo,name,address without using primary key .So we have more chance a rollNo is assigned to more than one students but each student have different different rollNo. So avoiding these type of anamolies we use 2Nf.
schema before and after the third normal form=>
If 	X is dependent upon Y and
Y is dependent upon Z then we say that
X is dependent upon Z
